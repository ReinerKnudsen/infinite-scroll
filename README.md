# infinite-scroll
ZTM Project creating an infinitely scrollable screen

This project is part of the ZTM JavaScript project series.
This app pulls images from [Unsplash[(https://unsplash.com) and adds them to this page. Once the user scrolls down the page more images are loaded.

To support users with slow network connectivity and mobile usage only 5 pictures will be loaded when the page is called. All further calls to Unsplash will pull 30 pictures.

I coded this project following the instructions. I only deviated marginally from the presenter's code.
Yet, I added the display of the attribution under the image. Being a [photographer myself](https://unsplash.com/de/@reinerknudsen) this is important to me.
